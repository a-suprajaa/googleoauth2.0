GOOGLE OATH2.0 implementation

What is google oauth2.0:
        
        Google APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. 
        Google supports common OAuth 2.0 scenarios such as those for web server, 
        client-side, installed, and limited-input device applications.     
 

Why google OAuth2.0 :

      OAuth 2.0 is a very flexible protocol that relies on SSL 
      (Secure Sockets Layer that ensures data between the web server and browsers remain private) 
      to save user access token.

      OAuth 2.0 relies on SSL which is used to ensure cryptography industry protocols and are being 
      used to keep the data safe.

      It allows limited access to the user's data.

      It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication.

      So, basically user can login with the gmail that is signed in the device without having
      to create and remember a new passord for each website.
